# Claude Code Context - Prototypes & Experiments

This repository contains prototypes and experimental implementations for exploring new technologies, patterns, and approaches.

## Prototypes Index

| # | Name | Description | Technologies |
|---|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | [gRPC Bidirectional Channel](prototypes/grpc-bidirectional-channel/) | Modern .NET 10 bidirectional gRPC protocol with real-time messaging and command/response patterns | .NET 10, gRPC, C# 13, Native AOT |

## Purpose

This repository serves as a sandbox for:

- **Technology Exploration**: Testing new frameworks, libraries, and language features
- **Pattern Validation**: Implementing and evaluating architectural patterns
- **Proof of Concepts**: Building minimal viable implementations of ideas
- **Learning**: Hands-on experimentation with emerging technologies

## Structure

├── prototypes/                    # All prototype implementations
│   └── grpc-bidirectional-channel/

└── README.md                      # This file
```

## Guidelines

### For Prototypes

- Each prototype should be self-contained with its own README
- Include build and run instructions
- Document key decisions and learnings
- Focus on demonstrating concepts over production-readiness

### For Experiments

- Smaller scope than prototypes
- May be incomplete or exploratory
- Document findings and observations

## Getting Started

Browse the prototypes index above and navigate to individual prototype directories for specific setup and usage instructions.
